# Quant Intern Prep Journey
## Introduction
This is will serve as a personal collection of my resources and efforts to acquire a quant internship over 2024. It will hold, among other things, a collection of various math, probability, logic, and programming questoins. 
It will also contain a link my discord server; this is what I use daily. This repo will serve initially as a means to become generally more competent regarding quantitative finance: as we approach crunch time, I'll be more
targeted in what exercises to do for what company.

### Pretext
Hello, my name is Colin. I'm a third-year Bachelor of Advanced Computer Science (Hons.) student at the University of Western Australia, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. I'm currently an Upper Second Class (75 - 85%) student, which'll have to be fixed. 

## Goals
All journies have destinations. While I'd gladly take any quant internship I get, the following five are my preference.


## Resources

### Books
### Guides
### Programming Resources
### Soft-skills

## Progress
### Mental Math
1. **Zetamac**
   - I started with a concerted effort on 09/01/2024 (Jan 9th), when my highest score was 50 and my average about 42. This is a relatively poor score for quants; I should aim for at least 70 -- I think 80 is safest though. I read online that I should be improving by around 5 per week.
   - 13/09/2024: My latest highscore is 57 and average is 48. Pretty big increase, and I think that factoring in diminishing improvements I'll hit 70 in a month or so.
3. **TradingInterview Hard Preset**
   - Yeah, this is hard. For the default 8 minute time limit my highscore as of 09/01/2024 was about 20. The passing score is apparently 56. That means all the right answers - wrong answers = 56. In 8 minutes. I know I got only 20 but that was my first attempt. How
     difficult could it possibly be to hit that?
